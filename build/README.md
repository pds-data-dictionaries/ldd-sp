# LDD Build Directory

This directory contains the schema files built for each release of the PDS4 Information model (IM).

## release/ Directory

The [release/](release/) directory contains a subdirectory for each IM version. Under each of those are
the dictionary files built for that IM release. 

## development/ Directory

The [development/](development/) directory is where schemas still under development and testing are built.
In general, you probably don't want these schemas unless you've been specifically directed to a development
version by the dictionary steward.
