The Spectral/Spectroscopy namespace (sp:) is a discipline namespace for the parameters 
(field of view, spectral binning, etc.) needed to describe observational data in the
most common data formats. The dictionary can be used for spectral bins in 
wavelength, wave number, frequency, or energy units. It can describe spectra
in tabulated, table, image, or cube formats. Spectral bins can be described in
the label, referenced in a data object, or referenced in another data product.

For dictionary developers, the IngestLDD file used to build the Spectral namespace is 
annotated for use as a cookbook for the features used in the namespace.
