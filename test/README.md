# Regression Test Directory

This directory contains files used to perform regression testing of the Spectral Discipline Namespace schemas.

> **NOTE:** The "valid" test labels do not attempt to show anything like a real-world use of the
>           Spectral Discipline classes.  They are "valid" only insofar as they meet the structural
>           requirements and content restrictions that are laid out in the Spectral Dictionary. ***Do NOT
>           attempt to use these as templates for real data without understanding the proper application
>           of the Spectral Dictionary metadata.*** 

The test file set includes:

* *SP-Test1-VALID.xml* and *SP-Test2-VALID.xml* - Two test labels that should show no validation errors
* *SP-Test1-FAIL.xml* and *SP-Test2-FAIL.xml* - Two test labels identical to the corresponding *VALID*
              labels, except with specific, documented errors to demonstrate proper behavior of key
              Spectral class features
* *No.Data* - A zero-length data file included to satisfy the *Validate Tool* requirement for a data file to exist

The labels are formatted to work with the automated build process in this repo, so all references to 
schema files have been removed. Test results are part of the reports generated by the _Actions_ used
to build the schemas.
